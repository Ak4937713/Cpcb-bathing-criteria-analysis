**Environmental Protection Rules (EP Rules 1986) – README Section**
About the EP Rules (Environmental Protection Rules, 1986)
The Government of India notified the Environmental Protection Rules, 1986 under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
These rules empower the Central Government (and CPCB) to:
•	Set environmental quality standards
•	Regulate pollution limits
•	Define procedures for sampling & monitoring
•	Specify industrial discharge norms
•	Enforce penalties for environmental non-compliance
These rules form the legal backbone for all national water quality standards, including surface water, drinking water, and bathing water criteria.
 EP Rules & Water Quality Standards
Under the EP Rules, the Central Government (via CPCB) prescribes water quality norms for:
•	Rivers
•	Lakes
•	Surface water bodies
•	Pollution control in industrial effluent
•	Bathing water quality criteria
The Bathing Water Quality Standards used in this project are officially defined under the EP Rules framework.

 Bathing Water Criteria as per EP Rules + CPCB
These limits are aligned with EP Rules for the protection of human health and water ecology.
Parameter	Standard
Dissolved Oxygen (DO)	≥ 5 mg/L
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)	≤ 3 mg/L
Fecal Coliform (FC)	≤ 2500 MPN/100 ml
pH	6.5 – 8.5
These thresholds come directly from CPCB norms formulated under the EP Rules.

Why EP Rules Matter for This Project?
Your analysis uses CPCB’s bathing water dataset and scoring model.
CPCB standards are enforced under the EP Rules 1986, which means:
•	The scoring system is legally valid
•	Suitability classification follows Government of India norms
•	Each parameter’s threshold is EP Rules–compliant
•	Insights from this project highlight regulatory compliance gaps
This makes the project valuable for:
•	State pollution control boards
•	Water treatment companies
•	Environmental consultants
•	Researchers & policy-makers

Regulatory Importance of EP Rules
The EP Rules authorize the Government to:
•	Regulate discharge into water bodies
•	Set limits for BOD, pH, DO, FC, heavy metals, oils, etc.
•	Issue closure notices to non-compliant industries
•	Mandate pollution control equipment
•	Empower CPCB/SPCB with monitoring powers
This framework ensures uniform environmental governance across India.
